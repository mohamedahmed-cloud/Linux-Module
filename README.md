## Error That face me in Learning Journey and task

```bash

    sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)  #Here all thing is ok so I Make a reinstall for header
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall linux-headers-$(uname -r)  # The error is still exit so I upgrade my system to lastest version but error still exist
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade #try to upgrade file system to last version but error still exit 
    #after all of these the error doesn't 
    
    
```
- AFter all these error I make and edit on linux system module [didn't remember it's name] and error another error appear
- After That I remove `-dev` {that contain device files used for interacting with hardware devices or software interfaces} and reinstall, and that didn't make sense
- After that I remove header and install it here return to the first error appear
- After All of these I make a `dsemg` to see error message and copy and paste in stackoverflow and found the solution   


```py
    # I feel this condition happened with me
    while(1):
        print("error")
        stackoverflow.search("error Message ðŸ˜‚")
```
